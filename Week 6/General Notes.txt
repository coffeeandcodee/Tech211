where camera can't be independently accessed.

Starting from "Scaffold a controller"

The generated code marks the controller class with the [ApiController] attribute. This attribute indicates that
the controller responds to web API requests.
Dependency injection is used to inject the database context (TodoContext) into the controller.
The database context is used in each of the CRUD methods in the controller.

Controllers with views include [action] in the route template.
API controllers don't include [action] in the route template.

When the [action] token isn't in the route template, the action name (method name) isn't included in the endpoint. The action's associated method name isn't used in the matching route.

The CreatedAtAction method:
- Returns an HTTP 201 status code. HTTP 201 is the standard response for an HTTP POST
method that creates a new resource on the server.
- Adds a location header to the response. This location header specifies the URI of the newly 
created to-do item.
- References the GetTodoItem action to create the Location header's URI. The C# nameof keyword is 
is used to avoid hard-coding the action name in the CreatedAtAction call.
