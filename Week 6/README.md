ASP :
Active Server Pages. Unlike static HTML, web pages are actively created using data held by server. 
ASP.NET Core is what is in use now, v6.0 or v7.0.

Alternatives to ASP.NET include Node.js (JS), Java EE, and Django (python). 

Model independent of view and controller. View and controller can be replaced and model can stay the same.
