PART 2:
MVC apps:

Models: 
Classes that represent the DATA of the app. Model classes use validation logic
to enforce business rules for that data. 
Models typically retrieve and store model state in a database.

Views: 
Views are components that display the app's UI. This UI generally displays the model
data. 

Controllers:
These are classes that handle browser requests, retrieve model data, and call view
templates that return a response. 

Seperation of concerns: 
Input logic belongs in the controller.
Business logic belongs in the model.

HTTP endpoints: 

Every public method in a controller is callable as an HTTP endpoint. 

An HHTP  is a targetable URL in the web application, e.g 
https://localhost:5001/HelloWorld

A HTTP endpoint combines the protocol used (HTTPS), the network location of the web server, including the TCP port (localhost:5001), and the target URI (HelloWorld).

In the above URL segment:
- localhost:5001/HelloWorld maps to the HelloWorld Controller class.
- The second part determines action method. e.g, localhost:5001/HelloWorld/Index causes
  the Index method of the controller class to run. Notice that this is the default initially.
- The third part is for route data. 

We can modify the code to pass in URL information to the controller, e.g /HelloWorld/Welcome?name=Rick&numtimes=4
We add parameters to the Welcome method and use HtmlEncoder
URL follows sytanx of 
/[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters]

public string Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1)
{
    return HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode($"Hello {name}, NumTimes is: {numTimes}");
}

This code uses the C# optional parameter feature to indicate that the numTimes parameter
defaults to 1.
HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode is used to protect the app from the malicious input, such as through
JavaScript.

Notice  the code
app.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default",
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
on Line 29 of Program.cs. id is default expectation of the parameteres part of URL. The trailing ? in id? indicates parameter is optional
