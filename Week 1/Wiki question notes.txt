THE FOLLOWING ARE NOTES IN RESPONSE TO THE GENERAL WIKI QUESTIONS (found under "engineering core")

Git is a distibuted version control system.


Git question notes 

1. git clone: This command sets up a LOCAL repository

2. Staging is the marking of modified files or just files to be added
   to the next commit snapshot. Done using:

git add.
git commit -m "Message"
git push/git push origin main

3. A commit is the saving of changes to the local repository. Done using
   git commit 

4. A git-ignore file is a file that specifies unintentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
   when uploading local repository content to remote repository (i.e running "git push")


OTHER notes:

git  init: 
Run this command in the folder to be controlled by Git to turn directory/repository 
into a Git repo (repository). The get init command creates a 
sub-folder called '.git'. This stores config information for the repo.
It remembers all the history, the versions of all files, and all branches.
It keeps track of where you are currently working (HEAD).

.gitignore files can be created via git. These are essential for excluding certain files
from Git control. Templates can be created via GitHub.


Powershell questions

1. md and mkdir can be used to make new repositories

2. To enter subdirectory, cd <directory name>
   to return to parent, cd ..
   to go to root, cd \.
   to go to home (Users\Ahmed), cd ~ 
 

3. New item can be made via new-item command
   e.g (New-Item textfile.txt)

4. You can get the content of a text file using  
   get-content <name of file>.txt

5. Other useful commands include Pipeline (|), return to home (cd ~), 
   Get-Process (returns processes that are currently running).
