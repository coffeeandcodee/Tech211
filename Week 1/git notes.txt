Git is a distibuted version control system.

Wiki question notes 


1. git clone: This command sets up a LOCAL repository

2. Staging is the marking of modified files or just files to be added
   to the next commit snapshot. Done using:

git add.
git commit -m "Message"

   Then 

git push/git push origin main

   To be added to remote repo (?)

3. A commit is the saving of changes to the local repository. Done using
   git commit. Done after staging 

4. A git-ignore file is a file that specifies unintentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
   when uploading local repository content to remote repository (i.e running "git push")


OTHER notes:

git status:
used to see list of locally modified files before committing

git  init: 
PETER OFFERED ALTERNATIVE of just creating repo on GitHub then cloning it locally 
Run this command in the folder to be controlled by Git to turn directory/repository 
into a Git repo (repository). The get init command creates a 
sub-folder called '.git'. This stores config information for the repo.
It remembers all the history, the versions of all files, and all branches.
It keeps track of where you are currently working (HEAD).

.gitignore files can be created via git. These are essential for excluding certain files
from Git control. Templates can be created via GitHub.
