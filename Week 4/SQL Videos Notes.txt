Null in SQL represents a missing or unknown value.
Null is NOT a value. 
Null is not 0, nor is it an empty string.
NOTHING EQUALS NULL.
Not even null equals Null. It can be true however to say that a missing 
value is Null, and that a known value is not Null.
e.g 120 != Null
Null can be thought of as the attribute of being missing or absent. 

NORMALISATION

Normalisation is the process of seperating data out into seperate tables

Pros: 
- Reduces data redundancy via eliminating repeated information.
- Increases ease of database maintenance. One source of truth for each entry, easier inserts. 
  Can insert data about single entity

Cons: 
- Increases depth via more tables. This increases difficulty of querying as multiple joins of tables is required.
 This increases the effort for the analyst or Dev. Writer of the query needs to do more work, but also server 
 needs to do more processing.

If speed is prioritised, an unnormalised database might be more suitable.

Normal Forms are properties that describe the level of normalisation of a database

First Normal Form (1NF) requires:
- Data must be atomic
- No repeated groups
- Each row must be unique

On top of 1NF, Second Normal Form (2NF) requires:
- All non-key attributes must functionally depend upon the full primary key.

On top of 2NF, Third Normal Form requires:
