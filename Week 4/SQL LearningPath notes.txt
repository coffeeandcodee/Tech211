1. 
SELECT statements are uesd to query the database and retrieve any data that matches specified critieria
e.g
SELECT column 
FROM table;

Majority of SQL engines are case-insensitive. A common practice is that keywords (SELECT, FROM) are typed in upper case. The names of things such as columns or tables in lower case.

SQL doesn't care about whitespace. The above query could've been written as 

SELECT column FROM table;
Readability convention suggests starting on a new line however, as done previously.

2.
SQL queries (Select Statements) must be written  with the various clauses in a set order. This is known as the logical sequence, or syntax sequence.

SELECT
DISTINCT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

The Syntax Sequence/Logical Sequence IS NOT the order in which each clause is actually processed by SQL.
This ordering is the Processing Sequence

FROM 
WHERE 
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
DISTINCT
ORDER BY
